This project is a modified version of the [Segment Anything C++ Wrapper](https://github.com/dinglufe/segment-anything-cpp-wrapper), designed to create a pure C++ inference API for Segment Anything, MobileSAM, HQ-SAM, and EdgeSAM models with no dependence on Python during runtime. The primary enhancement in this repository is the adaptation of the original C++ wrapper to work seamlessly with iOS applications.
